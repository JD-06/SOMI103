# SOMI103

SOMI is a system designed for the blind autonomous action, composed by: a glove that consists in a device with temperature, distance and blooding pressure sensors, operated with Arduino technology; a straps that consist in a device able to create spatial and time notions in relation of the distance between the user and the environment objects. And an application programmed in Java language in the Android Studio IDE, it has a personal assistant, an object identifier by a picture labelled method, a QR codes reader and it also has functions like consult and share location, consult time and weather status where the user is and text narration thanks to the recognizing of this one. 
The purpose of SOMI is give a system capable of expanding the capacity of the environment perception, so the main goal was the design of a functional prototype which proves that an intelligent system can increase the user independence. Likewise, the intention is to identify the way the user adapts to the notification system designed to determinate the way the user uses the system to complement his spatial orientation and spatial interpretation senses through the many system components.
